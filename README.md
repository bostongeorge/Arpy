Arpy
======

Network Monitoring Tool

Intro
======
Arpy was developed in c++ and tested on Linux (Backtrack 5r3). For best result and minimal configuration use 
BT5r3, or just change the paths to SSLstrip, Ettercap, and DNSspoof.

Arpy is the temporary fix until the python version is finished, which will not depend on 3rd party applications
to do the dirty work. Please come back for updates.

Lastyly, I am a hobby programmer so if you have a problem with this code, either fix it or go somewhere else. I
don't want to hear any complaints. 

Install
======

On Backtrack 5r3:

Compile: g++ Arpy.cpp -o Arpy

Execute: ./Arpy

Current Dependencies
